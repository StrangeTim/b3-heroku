2	Bussert Images	Sharon Bussert was born in Missouri and grew up in Salem, Indiana. While attending Purdue University she spent a year abroad in Madrid, Spain. This experience fueled her passion for travel, and she has since visited 32 foreign countries and most of the states in the US. In 2004 she moved to London, England. While in London Sharon began showing her work publicly and won several awards for her images. In 2007 she returned to the US, settling in Brown County, Indiana. \r\n\r\nSince returning to Indiana Sharon has focused her work on wildlife, landscapes, and floral portraits. She is part owner of B3 Gallery in Nashville, Indiana. Sharon works as a free-lance writer and photographer.\r\n\r\n\r\nJessica Bussert was born in Elkhart, Indiana to artist parents. She attended Purdue University and pursued a career in information technology. After a long and successful career Jessica retired from IT. While working as a volunteer EMT and firefighter in her rural community she decided to pursue a second career. She now works as an emergency room nurse in the travel industry. Her work involves taking short term contracts throughout the US, giving her a new palate to photograph every few months.\r\n\r\nThroughout her life she has worked in various media including glass, wood, and metals. In her photography she likes to seek out the hidden and unknown, or bring forth the obvious in a different light. Jessica has shown her work in both the US and Europe. She is part owner of B3 Gallery in Nashville, Indiana. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nJessica and Sharon often work together on their photography, and market their combined work as Bussert Images. They spend much of the year traveling together in a large motor home while Jessica works nursing contracts. Their work can be found in select locations in the Midwest and Western US or on their website, www.bussert.com. \r\n	\N	2015-10-27 16:38:00.510883	2015-10-27 16:43:37.018543	20061006-9637-Fog_House-low_res.jpg	image/jpeg	105908	2015-10-27 16:38:00.489375	2

2	Fog House	Brown County, Indiana	We spotted this image while returning from a party in Bloomington, Indiana. Wearing a short skirt and heels, Jessica demonstrated her dedication to photography by hiking out into a recently cut cornfield and setting up her tripod. As she triggered a long time exposure, a pack of coyote began howling at the edge of the field. Let's just say---that girl can run in heels!	\N	20061006-9637-Fog_House-low_res.jpg	image/jpeg	105908	2015-10-27 16:43:36.916517	2
3	Bean Blossom Bridge	Brown County Indiana	Built in 1880, the Bean Blossom Bridge is still in use today. It's often considered to be the most picturesque bridge in Indiana.	\N	20101023-8681-Bean_Blossom_Bridge_in_Fall_low_res.jpg	image/jpeg	632943	2016-01-09 22:58:07.078998	2

We also house working studios for several artists, and have a classroom where local artists host classes.

Local photographers Jessica and Sharon Bussert also have their studio in shop and will provide custom work. \r\n\r\nFrom May through November B3 Gallery hosts special month-long shows for featured artists. Openings are held from 5-8 PM on the second Saturday of the month, during the village-wide Art Walk. \r\n\r\nAny Indiana artist is invited to submit work for consideration in the gallery or for a special show.
